animalese.js
================

animalese.js is a JavaScript library that synthesizes an approximation of the
villager speech sounds from Animal Crossing. Demo up at http://goo.gl/5Ur53s.

It uses [riffwave.js](http://www.codebase.es/riffwave/) to turn audio data into
a DataURI, which can then be played back through an <audio> tag. Also makes use
of [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) and
[Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js). Thanks to Pedro Ladaria and Eli
Grey for these excellent tools :)
